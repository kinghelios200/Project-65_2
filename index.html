    <h1> Roller Blading </h1>
    <section id="about">
    <p> Roller Blading is a great sport and maybe you should try it to <br> What the Wiki says about Roller Blading: <br><br> Rollerblade is a brand of inline skates owned by Nordica, part of the Tecnica Group of Giavera del Montello, Treviso, Italy. <br> <br>
The company was started by Scott Olson (b. 1960), Brennan Olson (b. 1964) and Christopher Middlebrook in Minneapolis as Ole's Innovative Sports; when they sold the company, it became Rollerblade, Inc. and has changed hands over time between Nordica, Benetton Group and Tecnica.<br><br>
Inline-skates had been used for many years by ice speed skaters before they became mainstream. For the first few years after Rollerblade was developed, Rollerblade, Inc. were the only manufacturer of in-line skates that had worldwide distribution. This allowed the company to capitalize and grab a huge percentage of the world market share and almost total dominance of the North American market with aggressive advertising campaigns and sponsored in-line-only sporting events.<br><br>
Rollerblade, Inc. manufactures different types of skates, such as those for aggressive skating, fitness, or recreational use with removable "walkable" liners, as well as adjustable skates for younger users.</p>

          <h1>How I Started</h1>
          <p id="his">I started when my mom or my dad got me rollerblades, and I think one day i was like "Hey mabye I should use these" and then I started practicing with my grandma. <br><br> It was going great, but every time I would go down the driveway I would fall. And then it got to the point, where I decided to do a lap and now I can zoom that lap in under a minute, but back then it took like 5, 7, or 10 minutes.<br><br>I got better, and so on so on.</p>
